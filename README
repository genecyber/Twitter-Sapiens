This small script was created as a possible answer to Ruby Quiz 208: Twitter Personalities. 

Twitter Sapiens work basically by extracting all the words from a given sentence (its 'personality')
and then by extending these words using WordNet lexical dictionary (http://wordnet.princeton.edu/) in 
order to create a small amounts of nouns, verbs and adjectives from this group.

Then this 'mutually-related' words are composed using a sentence generator explained by Ola Bini 
here: http://olabini.com/blog/2008/09/language-generation and available here:
http://github.com/olabini/paipr/tree/7334d50b3b62924bc7c02effd22be0201658945b/lib/ch02.

At the last step the sentence built in this way is uploaded into a target twitter account 
as the quiz required.
